## About Telesales

Telesales is a web application for telesales representatives of different companies. Telesales representatives are those employees who work for companies as salesman but through telephone.
There are many telesales application already, most of them are desktop application (applications that needs to be downloaded and installed into your local desktop), but this project is based on web application, which we can access from web server. Just so that it wouldn't be a hassle of downloading and installing, taking up your computer storage.

## The main purpose of this project is to: 
- Create an easier applications to use for telesales representative while they work on the phone dealing with different kind of customers.

## This application will be used to:

- Display customer details
- Connect calls
- Record customer feedbacks and their complaints for the company
- Book company services
- Send offers as coupons, etc.

## Reason I chose this project 
Is because, I've worked on a telesales department for a short amount of time, but that time I spent working for a company was enough to encourage me that some day I'll make a better application than this, the one that isn't this much of hassle. Opportunity came as this college production project module. So, I took it.

This report will help you see the pain points of these kinda applications, specially those which I'm gonna take actions with.
